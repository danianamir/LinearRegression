Linear Regression Implementation from Scratch
Course: Advanced Algorithms with Dr. Farahani
Description:
In this project, as part of Dr. Farahani's Advanced Algorithms course, I developed a linear regression algorithm from scratch. The focus was on understanding and implementing the core mathematical concepts behind linear regression without the use of external machine learning libraries. The project involved coding the cost function, gradient descent optimization, and performance evaluation, providing a thorough grasp of the algorithm's workings at a fundamental level.
